# Tauri Plugin web-bluetooth

Native Web Bluetooth adapter for Tauri 2 apps powered by [`btleplug`](https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug). The plugin mirrors the browser Web Bluetooth API surface (device discovery, GATT connect, service/characteristic access, notifications, and availability checks) so you can reuse existing Web Bluetooth code paths inside a desktop Tauri application.

> ⚠️ The current implementation targets desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). All commands except `ping` return `UnsupportedPlatform` on mobile builds.

## Installation

### 1. Add the Rust crate

In `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` add the dependency (or use `cargo add tauri-plugin-web-bluetooth`):

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-web-bluetooth = { path = "../tauri-plugin-web-bluetooth" }
```

Initialize the plugin inside `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
	tauri::Builder::default()
		.plugin(tauri_plugin_web_bluetooth::init())
		.run(tauri::generate_context!())
		.expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### 2. Use the guest bindings

Bundle the TypeScript helper by linking the `guest-js` folder or copying it into your frontend project. Then import the functions you need:

```ts
import {
	requestDevice,
	connectGATT,
	getPrimaryServices,
	getCharacteristics,
	startNotifications,
	onCharacteristicValueChanged,
} from '@/plugins/web-bluetooth'

const device = await requestDevice({ acceptAllDevices: true })
const gatt = await connectGATT(device.id)
const [service] = await getPrimaryServices(device.id)
const [characteristic] = await getCharacteristics(device.id, service.uuid)

await startNotifications(device.id, service.uuid, characteristic.uuid)
await onCharacteristicValueChanged(({ value }) => {
	const data = Uint8Array.from(atob(value), (char) => char.charCodeAt(0))
	console.log('notification payload', data)
})
```

All payloads that carry raw bytes (reads, writes, notifications) are base64-encoded strings to stay compatible with Tauri IPC. Use `atob`/`btoa`, `Buffer.from`, or any Base64 utility to convert to/from `Uint8Array`.

## Available commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `get_availability` | Returns whether a Bluetooth adapter was detected on the host.
| `get_devices` | Lists cached devices matched via `request_device`.
| `request_device` | Scans for peripherals according to Web Bluetooth filters and returns the first match.
| `connect_gatt` / `disconnect_gatt` | Connects or disconnects the device's primary GATT server.
| `forget_device` | Removes a cached device identifier.
| `get_primary_services` | Lists primary services (optionally filter by UUID).
| `get_characteristics` | Lists characteristics for a given service.
| `read_characteristic_value` | Reads a characteristic value (base64 result).
| `write_characteristic_value` | Writes a characteristic (base64 payload, toggle `withResponse`).
| `start_notifications` / `stop_notifications` | Subscribes or unsubscribes from characteristic notifications.

Every command is gated by a dedicated permission (see `permissions/autogenerated/commands`). The default profile enables the entire surface; edit `permissions/default.toml` to tighten access before distributing your plugin.

## Events

Events are broadcast to every window through the Tauri event system. Use the helpers in `guest-js` or listen manually via `@tauri-apps/api/event`.

| Event | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| `web-bluetooth://characteristic-value-changed` | `{ deviceId, serviceUuid, characteristicUuid, value }`
| `web-bluetooth://gattserver-disconnected` | `{ deviceId }`

## Limitations & roadmap

- Desktop only (btleplug mobile back-ends are still experimental).
- `request_device` returns the first matching peripheral; build your own UI if you need multi-select or persistent device lists.
- Descriptor APIs and advertisement watching are not implemented yet.

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue if you find gaps with the Web Bluetooth spec or run into adapter-specific quirks.
